# FlamesCP
a lightweight mysql-free control panel for single minecraft servers

## Notes
Please move the authentication directory (security) to /var/www/security, if you would like to test this.
o.php is the console output reader - do not remove it!

The daemons are in the DAEMON directory - please start a screen for each and start them up seperately.
Make sure you run the daemons as root!

Also, please note that your server should be running in the /SERVER directory of the system, and not in the web directory.
